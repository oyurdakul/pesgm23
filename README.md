This online companion contains
1. [The historical dispatch levels](#empirical-records-of-storage-dispatch-decisions) of storage resources bidding in the Australian National Electricity Market over a select group of days. These details, along with price forecast errors were sourced from the AEMO NEMWeb data repository ( https://nemweb.com.au/ ) using the data extraction and analysis packages NEMOSIS ( https://github.com/UNSW-CEEM/NEMOSIS ) and NEMSEER ( https://github.com/UNSW-CEEM/NEMSEER ). 
2. [Statistical test results](#statistical-test-results-on-forecast-errors) on the distribution of the pre-dispatch price forecast errors for different look-ahead periods
3. The [source code](/model), [input data](/input_files), and the [results](/solution_files) of the numerical studies presented in the publication

## Empirical records of storage dispatch decisions

The paper contains two case studies of storage self-commitment based on empirical data from the National Electricity Market (NEM).  Below we set out the empirical records of storage dispatch decisions and prices for the trading days considered in the main manuscript (primary case studies) as well as additional case studies that are indicative of similar phenomena with respect to self-commitment of storage units in decentralized markets (additional case studies). 

### Primary case studies

1. [Victoria - 12 June 2022]
